      As someone with ADHD, I know the challenge of trying to meet your own
      personal goals. Collecting hobbies seems to be another hobby of mine. But
      even though I have ideas and gear for a dozen different things, I often find
      myself spending hours binging YouTube or playing videogames because that is
      easier than deciding what to work on next.
    </p>
    <p>
      So as yet another side project, I started to develop this app, where you can
      track goals, ideas, resources, and todo items. Soon, it will also allow you
      to share progress with your supportive friends, and integrate with your
      calendar so that work and personal projects can coexist with less stress.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm hoping that others like me will find this useful, and help spur me on to
      develop more useful features.
